# Compiling and installing JEMRIS with flow extension

## Requirements

Before compiling JEMRIS, make sure the following libraries are installed :

- CVODE 2.5         http://www.llnl.gov/casc/sundials
- CLN 1.2.X         http://ginac.de/CLN
- GiNaC 1.4.X       http://ginac.de
- Xerces C++ 2.8.0  http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c
- VarArray 1.0      http://www.fz-juelich.de/jsc/cv/tools/VarArray  

You may also want to install the boost C++ libraries and HDF5. IMPORTANT: Only use HDF5 1.8 as HDF5 1.10 will not allow compiling JEMRIS.

## Using AngioTK's docker image:

The AngioTK docker image comes with all the dependencies installed, except for GiNaC (Feel++ features a modified GiNaC version). As a consequence, we only need to install GiNaC.

### Before starting docker: cloning the JEMRIS repository:

We need a directory which will be mounted as a volume in docker and will contain the source files as well as all the data we may want to keep after exiting the docker container. Let's call it `shared`:

```
mkdir -p ~/shared
mkdir ~/shared/git
```

Clone the JEMRIS repository and switch to the appropriate `flow_loop` branch:

```
cd ~/shared/git
git clone git@github.com:vivabrain/jemris.git
git checkout flow_loop
```

To be able to compile JEMRIS while keeping the source directory unaltered, create an other directory and copy all source files inside it:

```
mkdir ~/shared/jemris_build
cp -r ~/shared/git/jemris/* ~/shared/jemris_build/
```

### Starting docker

We can now start docker using the appropriate options and mounting the required volumes:

```
docker run --name=myangiotk --pid=host --ipc=host -it -e DISPLAY=:$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v /home/$USER/.Xauthority:/home/feelpp/.Xauthority -v /home/$USER/feel:/feel -v /home/$USER/shared:/home/feelpp/shared feelpp/angiotk:master-ubuntu-16.10
```

### GiNaC installation

Install GiNaC (pick the development version as we need the header files)

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libginac-dev
```

### Compiling JEMRIS 

Use `configure` to prepare JEMRIS compiling, with the necessary options:

```
cd ~/shared/jemris_build
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/share/JEMRIS_flow2/ \
				--program-suffix=_flow2  \
				--enable-boost \
				--disable-mpi \
				--with-hdf5 \
				--enable-silent-rules \
				--bindir="/usr/local/bin" \
				CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -I/usr/include/hdf5/serial" \
				LDFLAGS="-L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/hdf5/serial" \
				CXXFLAGS="-std=c++11"
```

WARNING: If you wish to use HDF5, enable it as in the command above using `--with-hdf5`, but make sure to have HDF5 v1.8 and not v1.10. If you encounter errors like `undefined reference to: H5::CommonFG::openGroup(...)` it means you are using HDF5 v1.10 (which introduced a lot of changes in some classes used by JEMRIS).

You could also decide to change some options. For example, you could disable boost by replacing `--enable-boost` by `--disable-boost`.

Then, compile using `make`:

```
make -j 4
```

Run tests using `make check`

```
make check
```

In its output, pay attention to the following lines, and make sure the three tests were successful.

```
============================================================================
Testsuite summary for jemris 2.7.2
============================================================================
# TOTAL: 3
# PASS:  3
# SKIP:  0
# XFAIL: 0
# FAIL:  0
# XPASS: 0
# ERROR: 0
============================================================================
```

If any test fail, make sure the JEMRIS dependencies are installed and check the previously mentioned `configure` options were typed correctly. In particular, if you chose to disable the boost library in the `configure` step, `testcoils.sh` should fail as it requires the boost library. 

When you are satisfied with the tests results, proceed to install JEMRIS:

```
sudo make install
```

### Testing the flow loop extension

#### Installing the feature/flow\_loop\_simulations branch

The installation procedure is the same, except we switch to the `feature/flow_loop_simulations` branch:

```
cd ~/shared/git/jemris
git checkout feature/flow_loop_simulations
cd ~/shared/jemris_build
rm -rf *
cp -r ~/shared/git/jemris/* .
```

The docker command is also the same:

```
docker run --name=myangiotk --pid=host --ipc=host -it -e DISPLAY=:$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v /home/$USER/.Xauthority:/home/feelpp/.Xauthority -v /home/$USER/feel:/feel -v /home/$USER/shared:/home/feelpp/shared feelpp/angiotk:master-ubuntu-16.10
```

Don't forget to install GiNaC

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libginac-dev
```

Prepare JEMRIS compilation with `configure`:

```
cd ~/shared/jemris_build
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/share/JEMRIS_flow2/ --program-suffix=_flow2 --enable-boost --disable-mpi --with-hdf5 --enable-silent-rules --bindir="/usr/local/bin" CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -I/usr/include/hdf5/serial" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/hdf5/serial" CXXFLAGS="-std=c++11"
```

Compile with `make`, run JEMRIS tests with `make check` and install with `sudo make install`:

```
make -j 4 && make check && sudo make install
```

#### Flow Tests

Now we can test the flow extension. 

```
cd ~/shared/jemris_build/angio_simu/simu
jemris_flow2 simu_test.xml
```

The output should look like this: 

```
jemris 2.7.2 (5ae8ee4)

-1 CALLS 100 TRAJECTORIES
-1 number of trajectories loaded : 100
Model    : Bloch	  , solver = CVODE
Sample   : Vessels	  , spins  = 100
TxArray  : ./uniform.xml
RxArray  : ./uniform.xml
Sequence : ./sequences/GRE.xml

Simulating | ************************************************** | 100% done

Actual simulation took 7.52 seconds.
```

Since we only want to check if the software runs correctly, what really matters is whether or not the test passes (i.e. reaches 100%). The simulation time is irrelevant here.
